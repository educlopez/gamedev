# Gamedev
Gamedev is a collection of mini-games developed by me as I learn React, Next.js, and possibly migrate JavaScript to TypeScript. At the moment, there are four games available: Tic tac toe, Words per minute, Memotest, and Who is that Pokemon. Each game is currently in development and has a lot of room for improvement.

The project uses Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, and its user interface is based on the classic Gameboy design with some updated details. I created the Gameboy cartridge images myself, although the illustration for each game was created using Midjourney.

## Available Games
### Tic Tac Toe
The classic game of Tic Tac Toe. Play against a friend or the computer and try to get three in a row!

### Words Per Minute
Test your typing speed in this race against the clock. Type the words on the screen as quickly and accurately as possible.

### Memotest
Challenge your memory with this classic game of matching pairs. Flip over the cards and try to find all the matching pairs.

### Who is that Pokemon
Test your knowledge of Pokemon with this quiz game. Guess the name of the Pokemon from the silhouette image.

## Future Development
I will continue to improve and optimize these games as I learn more about web development. I also plan to add new games to the collection in the future.

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository
Install the dependencies using npm install
Run the development server using npm run dev

## Feedback
I welcome any feedback and suggestions for improving the code or the games themselves. Feel free to open an issue or a pull request if you notice anything that can be improved.
